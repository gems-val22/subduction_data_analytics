## Installation

To set up the project environment using conda, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/subduction_data_analytics
    ```

2. Create a new conda environment from the provided `environment.yml` file:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

3. Activate the newly created environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate subductionPCA
    ```

4. Install the `subductionPCA` package in editable mode:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Usage

To use the `subductionPCA` package, start by importing the necessary modules:

```python
from subductionPCA import preprocessing, Projector
```
For detailed examples on how to utilize the package, please refer to the demo.ipynb Jupyter notebook included in this repository.
